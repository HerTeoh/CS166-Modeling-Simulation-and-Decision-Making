# CS166-Modeling-Simulation-and-Decision-Making

The files in this repository is a collection of code that I have produced for assignments, pre-class work, and in-class activites as part of CS166 Modeling, Simulation, and Decision Making - a Data Science and Statistics concentration course - in the College of Computer Science at Minerva Schools at KGI.

A quick description of the files:
- Metropolis-Hastings Method Simulation
  - An implementation of the metropolis-hastings method that produces a batman logo distribution.
- Random Walk with Drift
  - to be updated
- Simple, Monty, and Earthquake Hall
  - The classic Monty Hall Problem is simulated to prove the probability differences of switching or not switching doors, with some other scenarios included.
- Traffic Simulation
  - Simulates the formulation of traffic jams on the road.
