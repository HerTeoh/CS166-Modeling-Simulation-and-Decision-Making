# CS166-Modeling-Simulation-and-Decision-Making
The files in this repository are a collection of code that I have produced for assignments, pre-class work, and in-class activites as part of CS166 Modeling, Simulation, and Decision Making - a Data Science and Statistics concentration course - in the College of Computer Science at Minerva Schools at KGI.

## Files

1. **Metropolis-Hastings Method Simulation** - An implementation of the metropolis-hastings method that produces a batman logo distribution.
2. **Random Walk with Drift** - A random walk model that predicts that the value at time "t" will equate to the previous value plus drift.
3. **Simple, Monty, and Earthquake Hall** - The classic Monty Hall Problem is simulated to prove the probability differences of switching or not switching doors, with some other scenarios included.
4. **Traffic Simulation** - Simulates the formulation of traffic jams on the road.
5. **Roomba Coverage (Final Project)** - A simulation of a Roomba (floor cleaning robot) where different strategies are evaluated based on its success in cleaning different types of environments.
