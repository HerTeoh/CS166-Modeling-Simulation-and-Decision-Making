# CS166-Modeling-Simulation-and-Decision-Making

The files in this repository is a collection of code that I have produced for assignments, pre-class work, and in-class activites as part of CS166 Modeling, Simulation, and Decision Making - a Data Science and Statistics concentration course - in the College of Computer Science at Minerva Schools at KGI.

A quick description of the files:
